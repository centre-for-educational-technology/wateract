The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users.

                    The Secure Sockets Layer is a protocol that aims to allow the applications to transmit information in a secure and protected way. The applications that use the SSL certificates are able to manage sending and receiving of the protection keys, and encrypt and decrypt information transmitted using the same keys. In this way, all sensitive data that travels inside the Platform maintains a heightened level of security. The same SSL certificate technology is used by Allikad.info partners when communication between different platforms is needed; this keeps the data transfer secure not only within the Allikad.info platform but also when transferring data to and from the partner platforms.
