                <div>
                    The aim of volunteer monitoring is to help scientists and governmental institutions to collect new information about springs and spring water quality. The data obtained this way help to manage and protect springs. Without your participation, this would not be possible!

                        Clean water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource around the world. We have to consider the fact that the most of the water (~97%) on Earth is saline, and liquid freshwater comprises only about 0.8% of the total amount of water on Earth. Most of the freshwater occurs in the form of groundwater. Springs are natural outflows of groundwater - hence an important part of the water cycle. In Estonia and Latvia, the situation with water resources is still quite good, but climate change and increasingly intensive human activities (for example, using pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture, ditching, mining etc) are leaving their mark on the availability and quality of our water.

                        Though spring flows are small compared to rivers and lakes, by studying their temperature and water chemistry springs serve as a window into the earth - their properties reflect the flow path and the geologic setting of the aquifer feeding the spring. This makes springs especially convenient and an easy observation location for the health of the aquifer.

                        Springs produce some of the most pristine freshwater and have been used as the main water source during the troubled times. Artesian springs have high reliability of water flow and no seasonal variations.

                        Since ancient times, springs have been important sources of water and sacred places. People have a deep-rooted belief in the sacredness of the springs and local legends often speak about the healing effects of spring water. Numerous legends about the value of springs as a life-savers during the wartime or droughts go back thousands of years.

                        In Estonia and Latvia, we still do not know how many springs we have and there is very scarce or no information on the composition of spring water. In the 1930s, it was estimated that there were around 4,500 springs in Estonia; later, it has been assumed that we could have as many as 15,000 springs. Today, there are just under 1,500 sources in national databases.

                        The wellbeing of groundwater and the springs as natural water sources has a huge impact on our daily lives - not only through the price of tap water - but we also need confirmation that spring water is clean and can be used in the future in the event of a drought or other emergency. Currently we do not know very well which residues of pesticides, nutrients or bacterias may have contaminated the springs. To maintain the water quality, protection of the springs and their catchment zone has to be ensured and monitoring of water quality has to be conducted regularly.

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        A spring is a place where groundwater naturally flows out of the ground - sometimes only a trickle, sometimes temporarily after a rain event or as a perennial flow. Groundwater forms aquifers, which are underground water reservoirs. A spring is the result of an aquifer being filled to the point that the water overflows onto the land surface.

                        In general, there are two types of springs with many sub-types:

                            <li>
                                Gravity springs (descending springs, hillslope springs) - emerge under unconfined conditions where the water table intersects the land surface.  The water moves through the ground until it reaches a layer it can't penetrate and starts flowing horizontally until it reaches an opening and water comes out as a spring. Gravity springs are usually found along hillsides or on sandy or gravely slopes. Gravity springs commonly form a spring run without a pool.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Artesian springs (rising springs, ascending springs) -  discharge under pressure due to confined conditions in the underlying aquifer. The pressure inside the confined aquifer (due to being confined between impermeable formations) is higher than the pressure outside the aquifer, so the water moves in that direction, preferably to converging to joints or faults perforating the upper confined layer. Artesian springs often discharge into a pool, in the bottom of which spring boils occur.
